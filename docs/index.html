            Given the great value of the investment being considered, there is a significant
            cost which must be accounted for. As you imagine, concerted effort has been made
            to pre<span class="spy-font">p</span>are for this. We have consulted several informants and experts, assessing
            risk and likelihood of success.
          </p>

            It is important to m<span class="spy-font">a</span>ke this clear: without your presence, this operation will
            likely be difficult. This is why I am making this information available to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            In <span class="spy-font">t</span>he next year, I have certain plans for you to carry out to make this mission
            possible. Your role consists in part as specialist given your prior expert<span class="spy-font">i</span>s<span class="spy-font">e</span> in
            this subject matter, but you will also be a key informa<span class="spy-font">n</span>t for distributing
            criti<span class="spy-font">c</span>al and sensitive matters. It may also b<span class="spy-font">e</span> necessary to transport goods.
          </p>

          <p>
            The question is whether you can recognize when something is off, and use it to our
            advantage.
